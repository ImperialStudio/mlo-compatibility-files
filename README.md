<h1>Imperial Studio MLO Compatibility Files</h1> <br>
We add compatibility files with other creators MLOs where files are conflicting. Typically these are either collision files (.ybn) or .ymap files. All of our MLOs are 100% compatible with each other and require no extra files to use all at once.<br>
<br>
<i>*We can sometimes accomodate your requests but we cannot guarantee all compatibility possibilities. Please create a ticket on our discord.</i><br>
